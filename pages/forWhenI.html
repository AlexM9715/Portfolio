            <p>When a user first enters "For When I...", they will be prompted to log in to their Spotify Account to be assinged a token. This token will give us access to specific scopes needed in order for the application to function properly. Once authorized, the token is stored locally and we are able to use "For When I...".

            <p>Once the user has logged in to their Spotify Account, they are able to select a category that was created and stored with MongoDB. When a category is selected, the user can randomly have a song selected that is stored within the database with that selected category. The song is  played with a Spotify Player NPM. The User will then have the option to add a song to a category of their choice.</p>

            <p>A user can look up either a Song or a specific Artist and their top 10 songs will populate using the Spotify API. When the user has found the song they want to add, they simply select the "Add" button and the Spotify Track ID will automatically populate on the right hand side of the page. From there, all the user needs to do is select the category they would like to add the song to and hit "Add Song". The user will be returned to the main page and free to get a new random song.</p>
